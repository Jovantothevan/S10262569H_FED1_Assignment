My idea of my website was to make an apparel store with mobile interactions. Stores that I generated ideas from were like Nike, Addias, Pull & Bear and Uniqlo as these storesâ€™ interfaces were things that I was planning to add into my website. I have plan to add banners to show featured items or even top sellers in the store also to add seasonal items. The brand will be called Shocker and the purpose of this website is to make online shopping much more efficient and convenient.

Features:
-Responsive design for both desktop and mobile platform
-Fast and quick interfaces for efficiency 
-Simple web design for simplicity
